Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Follow the steps below to add your API key to the project:

Sign Up/Login to OpenWeatherMap:
If you don't already have an account, sign up for free at OpenWeatherMap. If you have an account, log in.

Get Your API Key:
After logging in, navigate to your account dashboard. Look for the section where your API key is displayed or generated. If you don't have an API key yet, you may need to generate one. Copy your API key.

Add API Key to the Project:
In the project directory, locate the file where the API key is required. This is usually a configuration file or a script where API requests are made.

Insert API Key:
Find the placeholder for the API key in the file. It may look something like api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE". Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
